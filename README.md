# Welcome to my portfolio

I started this during my web developer training and continue to update it as I learn new things and create new projects.

It's still a work in progress, and I'll probably redo it entirely now that I've learned more things on web integration.
I just need to find the time for it :sweat_smile:

I have included the list of the languages and framework I worked with along with the projects made during my training and my internship.

They're the witnesses of my progress.
